I pick up the party telephone flyer. It says:

    "RIVERDALE TELEPHONE"
    "Still don't have a party telephone in 1916?"
    "Come to us TODAY!"
    
My husband told me that Mr. Hale was here yesterday for John Wright.
He wanted to get a party telephone with the Wright family.
But instead... he found Mr. Wright dead.

I guess Mr. Hale left the flyer here.
