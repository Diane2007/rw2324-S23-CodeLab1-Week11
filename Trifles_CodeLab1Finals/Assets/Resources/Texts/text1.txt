SHERIFF, MR. PETERS (Your husband):
    "Ah, my dear. A little bird like you shouldn't come to the crime scene like this."
    "Yet this really is an extraordinary situation."
    "As the men do the real work here, would you pack up some clothing for Mrs. Wright?"
    "I am afraid men are not suited for such... delicate work."
